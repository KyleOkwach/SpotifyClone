## Introduction
A music streaming platform created using PHP and MySQL.

## Description
As stated before, it runs on a MySql database that stores User data and music. Ajax was implemented to enable asynchronous transfer between the client and the server. For icons I used [Fontawesome](fontawesome.com/) and [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) which offer free icons.

## How to run
To edit the sass file, enable live watching so that any change is saved in the main.css file. Use the command below in the folder directory:
```Bash
sass -w main.scss main.css
```

To start a PHP server for the page, use the command below:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```
